            <p class="sad">I heard that you're settled down<br>
            That you found a girl and you're married now<br>
            I heard that your dreams came true<br>
            Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you</p>

            <p class="reflective">Old friend, why are you so shy?<br>
            Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light</p>

            <p class="intense">I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited<br>
            But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it<br>
            I had hoped you'd see my face<br>
            And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over</p>

            <p class="shout">Never mind, I'll find someone like you<br>
            I wish nothing but the best for you, too</p>

            <p class="reflective">"Don't forget me," I beg<br>
            I remember you said<br>
            "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"</p>

            <p class="sad">You know how the time flies<br>
            Only yesterday was the time of our lives<br>
            We were born and raised in a summer haze<br>
            Bound by the surprise of our glory days</p>

            <p class="shout">Never mind, I'll find someone like you<br>
            I wish nothing but the best for you, too</p>

            <p class="sad">"Don't forget me," I begged<br>
            I remember you said<br>
            "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"</p>
